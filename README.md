# Learning-tool

Spaced repetition algorithm that processes a dictionary of words and definitions, organizes them for efficient learning, and saves the final sequence to a CSV file. Then, I'll build a quiz game to test my knowledge. If I get a question wrong, I'll receive a score and start over, making it a fun and interactive way to strengthen my Python skills.
